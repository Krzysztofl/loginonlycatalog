About
-----

This small extension requires a customer to be logged in order to view products or product collections.
If the customer navigates to a page that contains a product or a product collection, she will be
redirected to the account login page.

This Module was designed to work with the Module [Netzarbeiter_CustomerActivation][], which
only allows customers to log in after they have been activated in the adminhtml interface.
There also is the [Netzarbeiter_GroupsCatalog2][] extension which allows you to hide Categories
and/or groups depending on the customers groups. Installing this extension together with
the Customer Groups Catalog Extension will probably make no sense, so you have to decide
what suits your needs better.

This module can also be installed from [Magento Connect][mc].
