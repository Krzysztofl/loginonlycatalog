Magento Module: Netzarbeiter/LoginCatalog
Author: Vinai Kopp <vinai@netzarbeiter.com>

This small extension requires a customer to be logged in order to view products or product collections.
If the customer navigates to a page that contains a product or a product collection, she will be
redirected to the account login page.

The module overrides no classes and only uses the observer/event model, so it
should play well with other modules.

This Module was designed to work with the Module Netzarbeiter_CustomerActivation, which
only allows customers to log in after they have been activated in the adminhtml interface.


The configuration for this module can be found in
System > Configuration > Catalog > Login only catalog

If you want to hide the catalog navigation to customers while the are logged out, you
can use this in your templates:

<?php if (Mage::getSingleton('customer/session')->isLoggedIn()): ?>
	[... navigation code here ...]
<?php endif; ?>

The files you will have to alter depend on your skin. In my case they were
app/design/frontend/default/my-skin/template/catalog/navigation/top.phtml
app/design/frontend/default/my-skin/template/catalog/navigation/left.phtml


I'm thinking about overriding Mage_Catalog_Helper_Category::getStoreCategories() so
the template modification wouldn't be required any more, but at the moment I believe
having the choice to let customers see the categories in the navigation while logged
out is the better option.
If you think otherwise please let me know.


TODO:
- Disable the catalog navigation within the module, so the templates don't need to be modified.


If you have ideas for improvements or find bugs, please send them to vinai@netzarbeiter.com,
with Netzarbeiter_LoginCatalog as part of the subject line.
