Magento Module: Netzarbeiter/LoginCatalog
Author: Vinai Kopp <vinai@netzarbeiter.com>

This small extension requires a customer to be logged in order to view products or product collections.
If the customer navigates to a page that contains a product or a product collection, she will be
redirected to the account login page.

This Module was designed to work with the Module Netzarbeiter_CustomerActivation, which
only allows customers to log in after they have been activated in the adminhtml interface.


The configuration for this module can be found in
System > Configuration > Catalog > Login only catalog

There you can disable the module on a global/website/store basis, and also choose to
hide the category navigation.

Overriden core classes:
Mage_Catalog_Block_Navigation
 - add the login state to the cache key


TODO:
- Make this thing use customer groups, and make categories and products viewable only by selected group(s)


If you have ideas for improvements or find bugs, please send them to vinai@netzarbeiter.com,
with Netzarbeiter_LoginCatalog as part of the subject line.
